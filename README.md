# Responsive Layout Demonstration

A mobile-first, responsive web layout demonstrating CSS Grid implementation across three breakpoints. This project showcases modern responsive design patterns with semantic HTML5 and CSS custom properties.

## Live Demo

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser and resize the viewport to see the layout adapt between mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## Features

- **Mobile-First Architecture**: Base styles optimized for mobile devices with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- **CSS Grid Layout**: Sophisticated grid system handling complex spanning and responsive column redistribution
- **Three Distinct Breakpoints**:
  - **Mobile** (< 768px): Single-column products, 2×3 service grid
  - **Tablet** (768px - 1024px): 2-column products, 3×2 service grid, expanded navigation
  - **Desktop** (> 1024px): 4-column service grid with featured image spanning, full-width navigation
- **Conditional Component Visibility**: Featured image module displays only on desktop viewports
- **Accessibility Ready**: Semantic HTML5 structure, ARIA labels, and reduced-motion support
- **W3C Validated**: Zero validation errors or warnings (HTML5 and CSS3)
